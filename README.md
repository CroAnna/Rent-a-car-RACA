# RACA - Rent a car app

C# and Windows Forms project connected with a MySql database (CRUD)

User has to login or register if he doesn't have an account. Users have 2 roles - customers or workers. Customers can only rent a car and see avaliable cars, and search them by car model. On the other hand, workers can add cars, change information about them and delete them.
